### Changed
- [] Watchdog releases require now Java 11 (and JavaFX SDK for workflow designer)
- [MOD] Modules are no longer shipped together with Watchdog. They can be obtained from https://github.com/watchdog-wms/watchdog-wms-modules

- [BASH] Last parameter of called command was not shown 
- [CMD] Removed unnecessary nesting of pre-defined TMP constant  
- [CMD] STRG+C signal is now caught by watchdog.sh as otherwise SIGINT is forwarded to all processes forked by the java process 
- [CMD] Fixed very rare null pointer exception that could occurr when a process folder is used (e.g. network failure during usage of network storage I/O call after existence checks)
