################################## MANUAL ##################################
The most recent version of the manual can be found online at 
https://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/files/Software/Watchdog/Watchdog-manual.html
and as HTML and PDF version in the folder named documentation.


############################## INSTALLATION ################################
Manually:

- Download a release from https://github.com/klugem/watchdog/releases
- Extract the provided archive into a folder of your choice
- Modules can be obtained from https://github.com/watchdog-wms/watchdog-wms-modules 
  or by calling modules/downloadCommunityModules.sh from the Watchdog directory

Via conda:

- conda install -c bioconda watchdog-wms

In that case binaries are named watchdog-cmd and watchdog-gui while the rest
of the files is located in ${PREFIX}/share/watchdog-wms-${VERSION}.


############################### RUN WATCHDOG ###############################
The distributed jar files are build for Java 11 and are called internally 
by the bash scripts. In order to run a xml-file using the command line tool, call

./watchdog.sh -x xml-file (or java -jar jars/watchdog.jar -x xml-file)

To call the jar file directly is not recommended as STRG+C signal will be 
forwarded to all child processes, which might cause errors on locally running tasks.

The workflow designer can be started using 

./workflowDesigner.sh or java -jar jars/WatchdogDesigner.jar

It will try to automatically identify the javafx SDK it depends on.


################################ JAR FILES #################################
watchdog.jar			command-line tool that executes Watchdog workflows
watchdogDesigner.jar		graphical user interface for workflow design and execution
