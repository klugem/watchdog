################################## MANUAL ##################################
The most recent version of the manual can be found online at 
https://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/files/Software/Watchdog/Watchdog-manual.html
and as HTML and PDF version in the documentation folder.

############################## INSTALLATION ################################
Manually:

- Download a release from https://github.com/klugem/watchdog/releases
- Extract the provided archive into a folder of your choice
- Modules can be obtained from https://github.com/watchdog-wms/watchdog-wms-modules
  and moved manually into the modules directory or by calling 
  modules/downloadCommunityModules.sh from the Watchdog directory

Via conda:

- conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge watchdog-wms

In that case binaries are named watchdog-cmd and watchdog-gui while the rest
of the files are located in ${PREFIX}/share/watchdog-wms-${VERSION}.

############################### RUN WATCHDOG ###############################
The distributed jar files are build for Java 11 and are called internally 
by the bash scripts. In order to run a xml-file using the command line tool, call

./watchdog.sh -x xml-file (or java -jar jars/watchdog.jar -x xml-file)

To call the jar file directly is not recommended as CTRL+C signal will be 
forwarded to all child processes, which might cause errors on locally running tasks.

The workflow designer can be started using 

./workflowDesigner.sh (or java -jar jars/WatchdogDesigner.jar)

The workflow designer depends on the Javafx SDK. The bash script will try 
to identify the install location of the javafx SDK automatically.

################################ JAR FILES #################################
watchdog.jar			command-line tool that executes Watchdog workflows
watchdogDesigner.jar		graphical user interface for workflow design and execution
docuTemplateExtractor.jar	generates templates for module documentation
refBookGenerator.jar		creates a module reference book based on a set of modules
reportGenerator.jar 		basic reporting of steps performed during execution of a workflow
moduleValidator.jar 		command-line tool that can be used to verify integrity of modules
workflowValidator.jar		command-line tool that can be used to verify integrity of workflows
moduleMaker.jar			provides a graphical user interface for module creation

All jar files except moduleMaker.jar are available in the jars/ subdirectory of the Watchdog 
installation folder. The ModuleCreator is not shipped with Watchdog but can be obtained by running
helper_scripts/downloadModuleMaker.sh located in the Watchdog installation directory.
See https://github.com/watchdog-wms/moduleMaker/blob/master/README.md for more information.
More information on how to use these programmes can be found in the manual in section 6.
